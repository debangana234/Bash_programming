Bioinformatics often involves working with massive sequencing datasets (e.g., FASTQ, BAM, VCF) and requires chaining together dozens of command-line tools. Knowing Bash allows us to:

- Automate analysis pipelines
- Filter, clean, and transform large datasets
- Manage files, permissions, and job scripts in HPC environments
- Work smoothly on remote servers and cloud platforms via SSH

Tutorial1  (`tutorial1.ipynb`) covers the fundametal concepts:

-  File system navigation (`cd`, `ls`, `pwd`)
-  Permissions & ownership (`chmod`, `chown`)
-  Script creation and execution
-  Finding files and managing users (`find`, `id`, `dscl`)

Tutorial2  (`tutorial2.ipynb`) discusses the `awk` tool

Tutorial3  (`tutorial3.ipynb`) discusses the `grep` tool

## Requirements

- macOS or Linux environment (or WSL on Windows)
- Jupyter Notebook or VS Code
